# Artifficial-Online-Handwritten-Mathematical-Expressions
This is artificial online handwritten mathematical expressions generated from CROHME database.
The pupose of this project is that generate a large online handwritten mathematical expressions database from the existed database (CROHME). Please refer to our paper:
